# tableau-js

This is a collection of all tableau-2.*.js files available on https://public.tableau.com used for the Tableau JS API.

This is an archive to help show the changes between versions.

In addition, an file called tableau-2.latest.js has been added with commits for each version, to show the history of changes over a single file.

The latest version of the Tableau JS API can be used by calling https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau-2.js (the latest version is visible in the code).

The latest *minified* version of the Tableau JS API can be used by calling https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau-2.min.js (the latest version is visible in the code).

This is the only available changelog from Tableau: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/js_api/en-us/JavaScriptAPI/js_api_whats_new.htm
